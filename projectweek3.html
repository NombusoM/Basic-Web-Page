      Crochet is a process of creating textiles by using a crochet hook to
      interlock loops of yarn, thread, or strands of other materials. The name
      is derived from the French term crochet, meaning 'hook'. Hooks can be made
      from a variety of materials, such as metal, wood, bamboo, or plastic.
